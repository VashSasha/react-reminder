# Remainder (To Do List)


Reminder is a task management program that allows users to create list of reminders.

New reminders can include several details including: a priority tag, a note about the reminder, due time. They can be marked as completed (checked) and are automatically hidden or completely deleted. You'll have access to a list of your completed tasks. 
In order to delete a reminder, hover cursor over the item and in a second you’ll see a little cross in the top right corner. By clicking on it you’ll completely remove the reminder from your list.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
